Oval Rotor Ducts
================
This scripts uses the adaptive templates functionality to add elliptical rotor ducts.

# %%
# .. note::
#    For more information on the use of Adaptive Templates in Motor-CAD, and how to create, modify
#    and debug Adaptive Templates Scripts, see :ref:`ref_adaptive_templates_UG` in the
#    :ref:`ref_user_guide`.
#
# .. note::
#    Adaptive Templates in Motor-CAD require v2024.1.2 (Motor-CAD 2024 R1 Update) or later and
#    PyMotorCAD v0.4.1. To update PyMotorCAD in Motor-CAD, go to Scripting -> Settings -> PyMotorCAD
#    updates and select 'Update to Latest Release'.
#
# This script is designed to be run from Motor-CAD template "e2", with Rotor Ducts set to
# 'Rectangular Ducts'. If no Motor-CAD file is open, the e2 template will be loaded, and Rotor
# Ducts set to 'Rectangular Ducts'.
#
#
# To set an adaptive geometry for a Motor-CAD file, a script must be loaded in to the Adaptive
# Templates tab (Geometry -> Editor -> Adaptive Templates) in Motor-CAD and run. When the option
# 'Geometry Templates Type' is set to 'Adaptive', this script is automatically run repeatedly to
# keep the Adaptive Geometry set in Motor-CAD.
#
# .. image:: ../../images/adaptive_templates/OvalRotorDucts_GUI.png
#
# This Python script can also be executed externally. When executed externally, a Motor-CAD instance
# will be launched and a file based on the "e2" template will be saved to a temporary folder. This
# script will be loaded into the Adaptive Templates tab.

# %%
# Perform Required imports
# ------------------------
# Import the ``pymotorcad`` package to access Motor-CAD. Import MotorCADError for error handling.
# Import the ``Ellipse`` function to create the duct geometry region with Adaptive Templates
# geometry. Import the ``os``, ``shutil``, ``sys``, and ``tempfile`` packages to open and save a
# temporary MOT file if none is open. Import ``deepcopy`` and various geometry functions to aid in
# building ellipses.

# Connect to Motor-CAD
# --------------------
# If this script is loaded into the Adaptive Templates file in Motor-CAD, the current Motor-CAD
# instance is used.
#
# If the script is run externally, these actions occur: a new Motor-CAD instance is opened,
# the e2 IPM motor template is loaded, and the file is saved to a temporary folder.
# To keep a new Motor-CAD instance open after executing the script, use the
# ``MotorCAD(keep_instance_open=True)`` option when opening the new instance.
# Alternatively, use the ``MotorCAD()`` method, which closes the Motor-CAD instance after the
# script is executed.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A python representation of the defining geometry of the motor may be fetched at the beginning,
# modified throughout the script, then set at the end to apply the changes. In this case, some
# trimming may be necessary, as motorCAD may have split the duct into two regions to make sure its
# geometry is valid. Since such splitting may or may not be necessary for our new, updated duct
# geometry, it's best and easiest to simply get one duct to retrieve duct information, while
# removing any additional unnecessary ducts from the tree.

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# One could use the geometrical information already present within the ducts to generate the new
# ellipses. However, it is simpler in this case to simply retrieve the defining parameters and
# use those to rebuild the duct geometry from the ground up.
# Ellipses are by default drawn to the right of the line connecting their start and end points
# Therefore, the elliptic arc forming the top should go from the outer point to the inner one,
# and the bottom should be formed by reversing that order.

# Regions placed on boundaries may still be used, but must be split into linked regions with
# defining geometry contained within the aforementioned section. This process is built into the
# GeometryTree function, fix_duct_geometry, which is applied below to the newly built duct.
