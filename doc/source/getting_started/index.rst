PyMotorCAD provides pythonic access to Ansys Motor-CAD.

To run PyMotorCAD, there must be a licensed copy of Motor-CAD v2023R1 or later
installed locally.

For more information on Motor-CAD, see the `Ansys Motor-CAD page <https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics/ansys-motor-cad>`_
on the Ansys website.

PyMotorCAD is installed with Motor-CAD v2023R1 and later for internal Motor-CAD
Scripting tab use. To install PyMotorCAD for use outside of Motor-CAD, it may be
downloaded from GitHub. PyMotorCAD will be available for install via pip in the near
future.
