Introduction
-------------

Ansys Motor-CAD is a dedicated design and analysis tool for electric motors.
It enables rapid and accurate multiphysics design and analysis of electric
machines across the full operating spectrum.

Today's electric motor design requires multiphysics analysis across a wide
torque and speed operating range to accommodate rapid development cycles and
system integration. Motor-CAD facilitates this cutting-edge design approach
by providing:

- Intuitive, template-based setups for fast initial electric machine designs
- Built-in electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical solvers for multiphysics insights
- Rapid analysis of efficiency maps, torque/speed characteristics and drive cycles
- Motor-CAD allows engineers to quickly evaluate motor topologies and concepts to produce designs that are optimized for size, performance and efficiency

What is PyMotorCAD?
--------------------

PyMotorCAD is part of the `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com/>`_ ecosystem
that facilitates the use of Motor-CAD within a Python environment in
conjunction with other PyAnsys libraries and external Python libraries.

PyMotorCAD uses a Python remote procedure call (RPC-JSON) interface for
Motor-CAD, to launch or connect with a Motor-CAD instance, locally or from a
remote machine via HTTP.

PyMotorCAD allows the user to programmatically create, interact with
and control a Motor-CAD model, with or without using the Motor-CAD GUI.
Motor-CAD automation can be achieved by scripts, either internally via the
Motor-CAD Scripting tab or ran externally.

Features
---------

Features of PyMotorCAD include:

- The ability to launch Motor-CAD instances and connect to already-running instances of Motor-CAD.
- The ability to control Motor-CAD by automation using PyMotorCAD API methods to carry out Motor-CAD actions, set and retrieve Motor-CAD parameters. For the full list of API methods, see :ref:`ref_MotorCAD_object`.
- The ability to automate workflows/methodologies within an instance of Motor-CAD via the internal Scripting tab. For details on internal scripting in Motor-CAD see the :ref:`ref_user_guide`.
- Automation control of Motor-CAD via external scripts. Workflows/methodologies can be carried out with either a visible Motor-CAD GUI or via BlackBox mode. For adding PyMotorCAD to your own Python see :ref:`ref_external_scripting`.
- The ability to control communication and couple/link Motor-CAD with other software (for example Ansys optiSLang)
- The ability to run automated sensitivity analysis studies and/or check tolerance build up to produce robust designs
- Allowing users to introduce their own formulations into Motor-CAD
- The running of multiple parallel Motor-CAD instances via an external script. Ansys OptiSLang can be employed to carry out detailed optimisations by controlling multiple Motor-CAD instances in parallel.
- Example scripts for tutorials on Motor-CAD features and abilities.
- Customisable example scripts for common or advanced workflows, both within Motor-CAD and involving the coupling of Motor-CAD to other software.
