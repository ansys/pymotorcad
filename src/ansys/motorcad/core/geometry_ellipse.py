class _BaseEllipse(EntityList):
    """Internal class to allow creation of Ellipses.

    Approximates an ellipse using circular arcs. the lengths of the major and minor axes must
    be provided, either by 2 points mirrored across an axis along with eccentricity, or by
    two points that are not mirrored. There exists only a single ellipse that satisfies
    passing through two points if they are not mirrored, so eccentricity will be ignored
    in that case.
    Begins by extracting the lengths of the major and minor axes from the given information,
    then approximates a single quadrant. It then mirrors that to create a full ellipse, and
    extracts the section of that full ellipse defined by the start and end coordinates.
    n defines the precision of the approximation of the single quadrant. As such, while it is
    correlated with the number of arcs in the final returned elliptic arc, that final
    number will vary based on the location and length of the elliptic arc defined by the
     start and end coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : Coordinate
        Start coordinate.

    end : Coordinate
        End coordinate.

    n : integer, optional
        Number of arcs used to construct the ellipse in each quadrant

    eccentricity : float
        Ellipse eccentricity. Unused when specified points and centre define
        eccentricity, which is all cases where points are not mirrored across
        a major or minor axis.

        Ellipse(start, end, eccentricity)
        Ellipse(start, end, angle, centre, eccentricity or depth (if required))
    Angle and centre may also be provided in either case.
    Default angle is equal to the angle of the normal of the line connecting start
    and end. If no centre point is given, the centre will be defined as the average
    position of the start and end.

    Angle and centre may be provided manually, though care should be taken when
    doing so, as if angle is provided and start and end points are not mirrored
    across a relative major or minor axis, *neither* eccentricity nor depth will be
    used, as the points already uniquely determine a single ellipse.

    Centre may be provided without angle, but doing so in such a way that points
    are no longer mirrored across an axis will result in an error, as the default
    angle results in points with identical x or y coordinates that are not mirrored,
    which do not form valid ellipses.

    A graphic helpful in showing valid start and endpoints for manually supplied
    centre and angle is shown below.
    Valid (relative) start and endpoints: the ** symbols show an example placement
    of start or end. All other symbols give information about the resulting ellipse
    if the other point were to be placed in that location. The ++ symbols show where
    eccentricity would be required, the == symbols show (relative) x and y axes.
    Whitespace results in no ellipse, while - results in an ellipse defined
    without need for eccentricity.

        Start coordinate.

    end : Coordinate
        End coordinate.

    n : integer, optional
        Number of arcs used to construct the ellipse in each quadrant

    depth: integer, optional
        distance between midpoint and average between start and end.

    centre : Coordinate, optional
       Centre coordinate.

    eccentricity : float, optional
        Ellipse eccentricity. Used only when points do not implicitly
        determine eccentricity, which is when they are mirrored across a major or minor axis

    angle: float (degrees), optional
        Angle of the relative x-axis (usually the major axis of the ellipse).
        When providing angle and eccentricity, switching whether the major or
        minor axis is used may be accomplished by leading supplied angle by 90 degrees.

    Examples
    --------
    A basic example using depth

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,-10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, depth = 20)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    An equivalent elliptic arc using eccentricity

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,-10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, eccentricity = 0.8660254037844386)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    Elliptic arc with changed centre, but same start, end, and midpoint

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,-10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, centre=Coordinate(-10,0), depth=-20)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    Identical ellipse with greater precision

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,-10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, centre=Coordinate(-10,0), depth=-20, n=15)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    An elliptic arc that does not require depth or eccentricity

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(10,0)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,20)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, centre=Coordinate(0,0), angle=0)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    An elliptic arc with manually supplied angle, centre, and eccentricity.

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(10,0)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, centre=Coordinate(0,0), angle=45, eccentricity=0.9)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)

    An elliptic arc that generates the same whole ellipse, but uses the minor axis by
    leading supplied angle by 90

    >>> point1 = Coordinate(10,0)
    >>> point2 = Coordinate(0,10)
    >>> ellipse = Ellipse(point1, point2, centre=Coordinate(0,0), angle=135, eccentricity=0.9)
    >>> draw_objects_debug(ellipse)
