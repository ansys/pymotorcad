Oblong stator ducts with thermal adjustment
=================
This script applies the adaptive templates functionality to modify rectangular ducts
into oblong ducts. Further, the thermal effect of modified duct is taken into account by modifying
the area adjustment under housing water jacket in thermal module.

# Motor-CAD Standard Template geometry - not the custom Adaptive Templates geometry. For example,
# when the stator duct geometry has been updated from rectangular to oblong shapes, the duct area
# has increased. For this example, the area increases from 6 mm\ :sup:`2` to 8.03852\ :sup:`2`. This
