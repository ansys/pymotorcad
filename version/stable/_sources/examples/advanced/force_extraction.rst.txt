Motor-CAD force extraction example script
=========================================

todo: expand this...

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-35

Perform required imports

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-37

.. code-block:: Python

    import ansys.motorcad.core as pymotorcad








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-39

Launch Motor-CAD

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-41

.. code-block:: Python

    mc = pymotorcad.MotorCAD()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-43

Disable pop-up messages

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-46

.. code-block:: Python

    mc.set_variable("MessageDisplayState", 2)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-49

Load a baseline model - in this case a template.
For users, this would normally be a baseline model

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-51

.. code-block:: Python

    mc.load_template("e9")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-53

Set up the point we want to extract

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-60

.. code-block:: Python

    required_space_order = 8  # Space order required, positive or negative
    required_electrical_time_order = 2  # Electrical time order required, should be 0 or positive
    operating_point = (
        1  # Which speed point to extract data for (between 1 and the number of calculations run)
    )
    rotor_slice = 1  # Which rotor slice (if more than one) that we want results from








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-62

Run the calculation (Assume that it has already been set up as required)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-64

.. code-block:: Python

    mc.do_multi_force_calculation()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-66

How many cycles have been run

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-68

.. code-block:: Python

    electrical_cycles = mc.get_variable("TorqueNumberCycles")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-70

Extract max space order that exists in the calculation

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-72

.. code-block:: Python

    mech_force_space_order_max = mc.get_variable("ForceMaxOrder_Space_Stator_OL")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-77

Get the indexes to use in querying the force:
required_time_order should always be 0 or positive. This is the order of
the number of cycles run, which will be the same as electrical order if
electrical_cycles = 1

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

.. code-block:: Python

    required_time_order = required_electrical_time_order * electrical_cycles








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-81

Results stored with negative space orders at the end, so apply offset

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-84

.. code-block:: Python

    if required_space_order < 0:
        required_space_order = required_space_order + 2 * mech_force_space_order_max








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-87

Find the force density using GetMagnetic3DGraphPoint:
Note the use of _Th1 for the 1st operating point in the name.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-94

.. code-block:: Python

    _, force_density_result = mc.get_magnetic_3d_graph_point(
        "Fr_Density_Stator_FFT_Amplitude_OL" + "_Th" + str(operating_point),
        rotor_slice,
        required_space_order,
        required_time_order,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-97

Apply 2x factor due to FFT symmetry, unless 0th time order (mean)
This is equivalent to showing results with 'Positive time only'

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-100

.. code-block:: Python

    if required_time_order > 0:
        force_density_result = force_density_result * 2








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-103
