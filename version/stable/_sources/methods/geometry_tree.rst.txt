Geometry tree
=============
The geometry tree object and its methods are used to define and modify
the Motor-CAD Adaptive Templates geometry using PyMotorCAD.
Geometry trees were introduced in Motor-CAD v2026R1 and are not compatible
with earlier versions of Motor-CAD. In earlier versions of Motor-CAD,
you should use the geometry objects and functions under
:ref:`ref_geometry_functions`.

More information on Adaptive Templates is available
in the :ref:`ref_user_guide` under :ref:`ref_adaptive_templates_UG`.

API reference for the Motor-CAD methods used for getting and setting the
geometry tree is available under :ref:`ref_Adaptive Geometry_API`.
